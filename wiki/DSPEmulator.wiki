DSP Emulator v0.10b3 by Leniad Soft 2001-2010


= Details =

Well, this is just another emulator!. But, where is the difference? This is a delphi open source emulator. There are not so many emulators in delphi...
Yes, its open source, you can compile it yourself. But you cannot use it for commercial purposes, and if you enhance a driver, please send it back to me and I will include it in the next release of DSP.<br>
Why delphi, and not C or C++ or Java or (put here your own language)? Well, delphi it is powerful enough to handle my emulator (120fps in spectrum driver with a 300Mhz processor!!!!) and it is as good as many any other languages.
You can not distribute this emulator with ROMS, except those that include the original ZIP file.<br>
Now since version 0.9ß3 portability has begun to Lazarus and Free Pascal, so there is a basic Linux version executable<br><br>
<b>1-. Emulation</b>
<hr><br>
+ INFO: DSP can handle ZIP format, you can load roms, tapes, snapshots or disks from a zip file.<br>
+ FILES NEEDED: DSP NEED to run a file that must be in the same folder as an executable file, this file you can download from  the same site and is the library 'SDL.DLL'.<br>
The ZIP also includes the ROMS Spectrum 48K, 128K Spectrum, Spectrum +3 and Coleco. You can download most of roms page of the emulator, and you also have the 'Spectrum is Alive!!!' where you have games for the Spectrum.<br>

<b>1.1-. Keys during emulation</b><br>
<hr><br>
General Keys<br>
    'F2' --> Full speed/Normal Speed<br>
    'F3' --> Reset machine<br>
    'F11' --> Changes emulation speed from 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%<br>
Arcade drivers basic keys:<br>
    '1' --> Start player one<br>
    '2' --> Start player two<br>
    '5' --> Insert coin<br>
    '6' --> Inser Coin<br>
Keys for both players are redefinible, and you can select any joystick for any player<br>
Spectrum/Amstrad basic keys<br>
    'F1' --> Play/Stop tape<br>
    'F4' --> Save snapshot<br>
    'F5' --> Remove Disk<br>
For Spectrum/Amstrad the no redefinible keys for joystick are<br>
    CUSOR KEYS --> Cursor Up, down, left & right.<br>
    LEFT ALT --> Fire<br>
In Amstrad CPC for use 'F1' to 'F8' keys you must press right Shift.<br><br>
<b>1.2-. Language Files</b><br>
<hr><br>
DSP is by default in English, if you want to change it using 'File -> Language' or click the Settings button.<br>
You can select Castellano, Catalan, English, German, French, Brazil or Italian and if you want to add another language to the folder 'LNG' edit the file 'español.lng', rename it and send it to me to add it to the next version.
If the language files are not present, the emulation can not start.<br>

<b>1.3-. Configure DSP</b><br>
<hr><br>
Clicking the Settings button you can configure the options in the emulator can select the language, quality of audio, video settings and default directories.<br>
In addition there are drivers that allow it can configure the options separately from the driver (for example Spectrum).<br>

<b>1.4-. Audio</b><br>
<hr><br>
You can select the sound quality: 11025Khz, 22050Khz and 44100Khz. The more quality you choose more cost to move emulation.<br>
If you do not have sound card (¿although there is anyone who has not?), The sound is turned off, don't worry. Anyway you can select the option 'Mute' to save a few frames ;-)<br>

<b>1.5-. Save Pictures</b><br>
<hr><br>
Since DSP 0.2wipb5 you can save GIF files from spectrum emulation (48k, 128k and +3 emulation).<br>
Since 0.7ß2 version you can save JPG and PNG formats from all drivers.<br>

<b>1.6-. Initial Game List</b><br>
<hr><br>
Since version 0.9 there is the possibility of booting DSP with the list of games, which shows the games, computers and consoles available. Further information on the availability of ROMS for each system.<br>
In general configuration you can choose this way of booting, or the old way (last driver load).<br>

<b>2-. Drivers</b><br>

- Border: Now you can choose line by line emulation or pixel by pixel emulation (slowly but more exact) and disable border emulation.<br>
- Keyboard: Fully working keyboard emulation, and LShift and LControl working as Capshift and SimbolShift.<br>
- Joystick: You can choose from four joysticks; Kempston, Cursor, Sinclair 1 and Sinclair 2. Joystick ir emulated with cursor keys and left alt as fire button.<br>

<hr><br>
-ROM: The default ROM is 'COLECO.ZIP' and within 'COLECO.ROM'. Without it can not begin the emulation.<br>
-Joystick: The numbers on the keyboard from '1'to '0' emulate the keys on the two joysticks. Keys 'Q' and 'W' emulate the Keys '*' and '#' of the two joysticks also, and the arrow keys to 'CTRL' and 'ALT' left emulate the main joystick (The secondary joystick does not have keys assigned). Does not support (even) the special joysticks.<br>

You can contribute in the emulator DSP! Get the source code and works on the drivers. Do you help me? If so, please contact me!<br>
Have you done a new driver? Do you have any idea? Well then contact me! Anything is good!<br><br>

<b>4-. Acknowledgments</b><br>
<hr><br><br>
- First, of course, the MAME team. Without them, this emulator never had existed, thanks to distribute the source code to help many people, people like me. (And of course the 'MAME guru' Nicola Salmoria).<br>
- Chris Cowley, author of VBSpec, from where I've pick a lot of information about that little black box called Spectrum, I never belived how powerful it was... In addition I've also got the part of the AY-3-8912 of its emulator, which is an excellent conversion that comes with MAME, and sounds very good!<br>
- Raul Gomez Sanchez author of the R80, one of the best Spectrum emulators for DOS, which use your debugger to trace errors in my emulator Z80.<br>
- These awesome guys from World of Spectrum!! I have taken many tapes and snapshots of his page, in addition to technical information, including the format TZX. Don't you miss his page!<br>
- javi[@]fsmail.net that helped me in a moment of desperation, with directSound!<br>
- Thanks to Michael Franzen, who sent me drivers for Pooyan, Coleco, System1 and many others to be included in DSP.<br>
- Thanks to Tom Walker, he sent me his driver CPS1 where I got and understood a lot of
information.<br>
- And many pages of the Internet, many documents ... and people who I forget, thank you all.<br><br>
