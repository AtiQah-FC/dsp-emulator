DSP Emulator v0.14 - Leniad 2001-2011


= Details =

Well, this is just another emulator... but, what's the difference? This is a pascal open source emulator using Delphi/Lazarus enviroment. There are not so many emulators in pascal...<br>
Yes, its open source, you can compile it yourself. But you cannot use it for commercial purposes.<br>
Why pascal, and not C, C++, Java or any other languaje? Well, pascal it is powerful enough to handle my emulator (120fps in spectrum driver with a Pentium CPU) and it is as good as many any other languages.<br>
You can not distribute this emulator with ROMS, except those that include the original ZIP file.<br>
Since version 0.9ß3 portability has begun to Lazarus/Free Pascal, so there is a Linux 32/64bits version available.<br><br>
<b>1-. Emulation</b>
<hr>
+ INFO: Emulator can handle ZIP format. You can load roms, tapes, snapshots or disks from a ZIP file.<br>
+ FILES NEEDED: In Windows the emulator needs the library 'SDL.DLL' that must be in the same folder that the executable, you can download it from the emulator site or you can download the last version from 'www.libsdl.org'.<br>
In Linux this library comes with your OS.<br><br>
The emulator includes (not in WIP versions) inside the ZIP the ROMS for Spectrum 48K/128K/+3 (and variants), Amstrad CPC 464/664/6128 and Coleco. You can download more tapes, disks and coleco ROMS from the 'Spectrum is Alive!!!' and 'Coleco is Alive!!!' pages, from the original emulator web.<br><br>
IS NOT ALLOWED DISTRIBUTE THIS EMULATOR WITH A COPYRIGHTED ROMS.<br><br>
<b>1.1-. Keys during emulation</b><br>
<hr>
General Keys:<br>
    'F2' --> Full speed/Normal Speed<br>
    'F3' --> Reset machine<br>
    'F11' --> Changes emulation speed from 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%<br><br>
Arcade drivers basic keys are redefinable, by default are:<br>
    '1' --> Start player one<br>
    '2' --> Start player two<br>
    '5' --> Insert coin<br>
    '6' --> Inser Coin<br>
Keys for both players are redefinable, and you can select any joystick for any player and up to 6 buttons per player, by default keys are:<br>
    Player 1 Up       --> Key 'Cursor UP'<br>
    Player 1 Down     --> Key 'Cursor DOWN'<br>
    Player 1 Left     --> Key 'Cursor LEFT'<br>
    Player 1 Right    --> Key 'Cursor RIGHT'<br>
    Player 1 Button 1 --> Key 'LEFT CONTROL'<br>
    Player 1 Button 2 --> Key 'LEFT ALT'<br>
Any other control, by default, is not defined. You can redefine it in the main configuration menu.<br><br>
Spectrum/Amstrad basic keys:<br>
    'F1' --> Play/Stop tape<br>
    'F4' --> Save snapshot<br>
    'F5' --> Remove Disk<br>
The joystick uses keys redefinable or external joystick.<br>
In Amstrad CPC for use 'F1' to 'F10' keys you must press right Shift.<br><br>
<b>1.2-. Language Files</b><br>
<hr>
DSP is by default in English, if you want to change it using 'File -> Language' or click the Settings button. You can select Castellano, Catalan, English, German, French, Brazilian or Italian.<br>
If you want to add another language, edit any file whith the extension '.lng' in the 'LNG' directory, rename it with the name of the languaje and send it to me to add it to the next version.<br>
If the language files are not present, the emulation can not start.<br><br>
<b>1.3-. Configure DSP</b><br>
<hr>
Clicking the Settings button you can configure the options in the emulator can select the language, quality of audio, video settings, default directories, redefine keys/use joystick and redefine main keys.<br>
In addition there are systems that can configure the options separately from the driver (Spectrum) and in arcade drivers, since version 0.12ß4 dipswitches can be modified through this button, to set game options.<br><br>
<b>1.4-. Audio</b><br>
<hr>
You can select the sound quality: 11025Khz, 22050Khz and 44100Khz. The more quality you choose more cristal crear will sound the emulation.<br>
If you do not have sound card the sound is turned off. Anyway you can select the option 'Mute' to save a few frames.<br><br>
<b>1.5-. Save Pictures</b><br>
<hr>
Since DSP 0.2wipb5 you can save GIF files from Spectrum emulation.<br>
Since 0.7ß2 version you can also save JPG and PNG formats from all drivers.<br><br>
<b>1.6-. Initial Game List</b><br>
<hr>
Since version 0.9 there is the possibility of booting DSP with the list of games, which shows the games, computers and consoles available. Further information on the availability of ROMS for each system, distribution year, conpany, etc.<br>
In general configuration you can choose this way of booting (show a game list), or the old way (load the last driver).<br><br>
<b>2-. Drivers</b><br>
<hr><br>
<b>2.1 Computers</b><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Spectrum</b><br>
<hr>
This driver have it's own configuration system. You can choose:<br>
- ROMS: You can change Spectrum's ROM. Configure you favorite ROM in 'ZIP' format (the name of the ROM inside the ZIP must be the same of ZIP name, for example 'SPECTRUM.ZIP' and the ROM inside the ZIP 'SPECTRUM.ROM') or in ROM format.<br>
By default the ROM files are:<br>

If inside the ZIP file there is a ROM file, emulator load fisrt ROM file and then loads then virtual tape.<br>
Also, if inside the ZIP is a .SCR image, it's used as a preview.<br>

<b>2.3 Arcade</b><br>
<hr><br>
<b>2.3.1 Samples</b><hr>
Some games, given the difficulty of emulating old sound systems, uses 'samples'. Such files are portions of digitized sound, played instead of emulating the sound system.br>
Currently only some drivers use wholly or partly this system.<br>
If you want the emulator to use the samples, put the files with the same name as the ROM in a folder named 'samples'.<br>

<hr>
If you make any improvements to any driver, processor, main code, etc. or add drivers, please send the changes to me, so they can be added to the main code.br>
If you use part of the code of the emulator for any non commercial purpose, you only need to add in the documentation/source something like 'Z80 core written by Leniad'. And please send me a email to see the written program. :-)br><br>
<b>4-. Acknowledgments</b><br>
<hr>
- First, of course, the MAME team. Without them, this emulator never had existed, thanks to distribute the source code to help many people, people like me. (And of course the 'MAME guru' Nicola Salmoria).br>
- Chris Cowley, author of VBSpec, from where I've pick a lot of information about Spectrum. In addition I've also got the part of the AY-3-8912 of its emulator, which is an excellent conversion that comes with MAME.<br>
- Raul Gomez Sanchez author of the R80, one of the best Spectrum emulators for DOS, which use your debugger to trace errors in my emulator Z80.<br>
- World of Spectrum, they have many tapes, snapshots, in addition many technical information, including the format TZX, DSK, Z80, etc.<br>
- javi{{{[@]}}}fsmail.net that helped me in a moment of desperation, with directSound.<br>
- Thanks to Michael Franzen, who sent me drivers for Pooyan, Coleco, System1, Chip8 and many others to be included in DSP.<br>
- Thanks to Tom Walker, he sent me his driver CPS1 where I got and understood a lot of information.<br>
- Thanks to sremulador he made the drivers list, and constant source updates and for begin the rewriting of NES driver<br>
- And many pages of the Internet, many documents ... and people who I forget, thank you all.<br><br>
