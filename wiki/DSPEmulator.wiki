DSP Emulator v0.9ß3 by Leniad Soft 2001-2010


= Details =

Well, this is just another emulator!. But, where is the difference? This is a delphi open source emulator. There are not so many emulators in delphi...<br>
Yes, its open source, you can compile it yourself. But you cannot use it for commercial purposes, and if you enhance a driver, please send it back to me and I will include it in the next release of DSP.<br>
Why delphi, and not C or C++ or Java or (put here your own language)? Well, delphi it is powerful enough to handle my emulator (120fps in spectrum driver with a 300Mhz processor!!!!) and it is as good as any other languages.<br>
You can not distribute this emulator with ROMS, except those that include the original ZIP file.<br>

<b>1-. Emulation</b>
<hr><br>
+ INFO: DSP can handle ZIP format, you can load roms, tapes, snapshots or disks from a zip file.<br>
+ FILES NEEDED: DSP NEED to run a file that must be in the same folder as an executable file, this file you can download from  the same site and is the library 'SDL.DLL'.<br>
The ZIP also includes the ROMS Spectrum 48K, 128K Spectrum, Spectrum +3 and Coleco. You can download most of roms page of the emulator, and you also have the 'Spectrum is Alive!!!' where you have games for the Spectrum.<br>

<b>1.1-. Keys during emulation</b><br>
<hr><br>
1 --> Start one player<br>
5 --> Insert coin<br>
F1 --> Play/Stop tape<br>
F2 --> Full speed/Normal Speed<br>
F3 --> Reset machine<br>
F4 --> Save snapshot (not working during Full Screen Mode)<br>
F5 --> Remove Disk (Spectrum +3 and Amstrad CPC)<br>
F11 --> Changes emulation speed from 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%<br>
CUSOR KEYS --> Up, down, left & right. (In spectrum and Amstrad are joystick)<br>
LEFT ALT & LEFT CTRL --> Action. (In Spectrum Kempston Joystick fire button)<br><br>
Not all keys work during emulation, for example in phoenix you can not play/pause a tape!<br>
<b>1.2-. Language Files</b><br>
<hr><br>
DSP is by default in English, if you want to change it using 'File -> Language' or click the Settings button.<br>
You can select Castellano, Catalan, English, German, French or Brazil and if you want to add another language to the folder 'LNG' edit the file 'español.lng', rename it and send it to me to add it to the next version.<br>
If the language files are not present, the emulation can not begin.<br>

<b>1.3-. Configure DSP</b><br>
<hr><br>
Clicking the Settings button you can configure the options in the emulator can select the language, quality of audio, video settings and default directories.<br>
In addition there are drivers that allow it can configure the options separately from the driver. (for example Spectrum)<br>

<b>1.4-. Audio</b><br>
<hr><br>
You can select the sound quality: 11025Khz, 22050Khz and 44100Khz. The more quality you choose more cost to move emulation, I recommend 22050Khz which is a sufficient value to almost everything.<br>
If you do not have sound card (¿although there is anyone who has not?), The sound is turned off, don't worry. Anyway you can select the option 'Mute' to save a few frames ;-)<br>

<b>1.5-. Save Pictures</b><br>
<hr><br>
Since DSP 0.2wipb5 you can save GIF files from spectrum emulation (48k, 128k and +3 emulation).<br>
Since 0.7ß2 version you can save JPG and PNG formats<br>

<b>1.6-. Initial Game List</b><br>
<hr><br>
Since version 0.9 there is the possibility of booting DSP with the list of games, which shows the games, computers and consoles available. Further information on the availability of ROMS for each system.<br>
In general configuration you can choose this way of booting, or the old way (last driver load).<br>

<b>2-. Drivers</b><br>
<hr><br>
<b>Spectrum 48k, 128K and Plus+3 </b><br>
<hr><br>
- ROMS: Now you can change Spectrum's ROM. Configure you favorite ROM in 'ZIP' format (the name of the ROM inside the ZIP must be the same of ZIP name) or in ROM format. By default the ROM files are: SPECTRUM.ZIP (Spectrum 48K), SPEC128.ZIP (Spectrum 128K) y PLUS3.ZIP (Spectrum Plus+3).<br>

If inside the ZIP file there is a ROM file, emulator load fisrt ROM file and then loads then virtual tape.<br>
Also, if inside the ZIP is a .SCR image, it's used as a preview.<br>

3-. Contributions
-----------------
You can contribute in the emulator DSP! Get the source code and works on the drivers. Do you help me? So please contact me! 
Have you done a new driver? Do you have any idea? Well then contact me! Anything is good!

4-. Acknowledgments<br>
-------------------<br>
* First, of course, the team's MAME. Without them, this emulator never had existed, thanks to distribute the code source to help many people, people like me. (And of course the 'MAME guru' Nicola Salmoria). <br>
* Chris Cowley, author of VBSpec, from where I've pick a lot of information about that little black box called Spectrum, 
I never belived how powerful it was... In addition I've also got the part of the AY-3-8912 of its emulator, which is an excellent conversion that comes with MAME, and sounds very good! <br>
* Raul Gomez Sanchez author of the R80, one of the best Spectrum emulators for DOS, which use your debugger to locate errors in my emulator Z80. <br>
* These awesome guys from World of Spectrum!! I have taken many tapes and snapshots of his page, in addition to technical information, including the format TZX. Do not miss this page!<br>
* Javi [@] fsmail.net that helped me in a moment of desperation, with DirectSound! <br>
* Thanks to Michael Franzen, who sent me so disinterested drivers Pooyan, Coleco, System1 and many others! to be included in DSP. <br>
* And many pages of the Internet, many documents ... and people who I forget, thank you all.<br><br>
